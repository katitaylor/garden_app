Technical Requirements

The app must:

* Have at least 2 models (more if they make sense) â€“ one representing someone using your application, and one that represents the main functional idea for your app
* Include sign up/log in functionality, with encrypted passwords & an authorization flow
* Have complete RESTful routes for at least one of your resources with GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE
* Utilize an ORM (ActiveRecord) to create a database table structure and interact with your relationally-stored data
* Include wireframes that you designed during the planning process
* Have semantically clean HTML and CSS
* Be deployed online and accessible to the public

Necessary Deliverables

* A working full-stack application, built by you, hosted somewhere on the internet :: https://pacific-inlet-52173.herokuapp.com/
* A link to your hosted working app in the URL section of your Github repo
* A git repository hosted on Github, with a link to your hosted project, and frequent commits dating back to the very beginning of the project. Commit early, commit often.
* A readme.md file with explanations of the technologies used, the approach taken, installation instructions, unsolved problems, etc.
* Wireframes and ERD's of your app, hosted somewhere & linked in your readme
* A link in your readme.md to the publically-accessible user stories you created
